## EggMaker: Create an EGG archive

Create a .BASKET file and pack files into multiple .EGG files with specified size.
Files smaler than <size> will be joined into a single EGG, and files larger than
<size> will be split across multiple eggs.

## Eggstractor: Open/Extract an EGG archive

Open a .BASKET table-of contents and extract files from .EGG files associated with it.
Even if some EGGs are missing, you can still extract files located in other EGGs

## Eggexutor: Extract contents of a single EGG, even if its associated BASKET file is lost

Open a single .EGG file and extract files from it using built-in table of contents.
